# Classification of customers as returning on non returing on the Google E-commerce platform


Ecommerce data from the real Google Ecommerce storefront: https://shop.googlemerchandisestore.com/ has been used.
The visitor and order data has been loaded into BigQuery and a machine learning model has been built to predict whether a visitor will return for more purchases later.

Following tasks have been performed:

1. Use BigQuery to find public datasets

2. Query and explore the ecommerce dataset

3. Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction

4. Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BigQuery ML

5. Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model

6. Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase

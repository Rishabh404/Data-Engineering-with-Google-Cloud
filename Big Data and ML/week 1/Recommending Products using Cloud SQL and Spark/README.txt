# Recommending Products Using Cloud SQL and Spark
In this lab, I have populated rentals data in Cloud SQL for the rentals recommendation engine to use. 
The recommendations engine itself will run on Dataproc using Spark ML.

1. Create Cloud SQL instance
2. Create database tables by importing .sql files from Cloud Storage
3. Populate the tables by importing .csv files from Cloud Storage
4. Allow access to Cloud SQL
5. Explore the rentals data using SQL statements from CloudShell
